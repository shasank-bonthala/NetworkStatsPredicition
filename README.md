## Introduction

The internet as we know it was introduced all the way back in 1983 but it wasn’t until 1994 that a company known as NetMarket first started selling internet services. And since then, the satellite service providing industry has increased exponentially. Every company aims to provide the best network conditions to customers in an industry where quality is so important. And that is specifically where improvements can always be made. Being able to detect network issues and monitor network performance for issues is so important in the real world for positive customer experience and that is the problem we home to tackle with our project. At the end of the day, the customer makes the business and increasing customer satisfaction is always a priority in successful business. 

Before going into the specifics about the approach to tackling this problem, it is important to understand a few key technical terms. The two biggest network conditions that we are targeting with this project are latency and packet loss. Packet loss refers to the loss in packets of data when these packets of data don’t reach the destination. This will be represented as a ratio in our project. The packet loss ratio is the number of packets lost divided by the total number of packets since the last lost one (1/2000 refers to 1 packet lost out of 2000 packets). Latency on the other hand, refers to delays in the network that are observed from a cause and effect of some physical change in the system. This will be represented in our data as an integer. Being able to successfully predict these could be instrumental for Viasat as this will allow service providers to better monitor network performance and identify issues.

### Motivating Problem

The motivating problem is that predicting latency and packet loss can be extremely beneficial from a network providers perspective as they aim to give out the best service possible. This information is vital in the monitoring of network conditions to ensure the quality of the product. Being able to predict these issues based on machine learning models before they happen will drastically improve the internet experience for hundred of thousands of customers.

### Why should you care?

As a cusutomer, this type of analysis is so important when choosing the right internet provider. Machine learning has become the future of the industry and using it to further improve customer experience is a real plus. The benefits of this research are profound and can truly revolutionize the industry. Being able to predict when packets may be lost or when latency issues will occur from a internet provider's perspective can be beneficial as they monitor their networks. They could then reroute traffic or use other creative ideas to solve these issues and improve the overall experience for customers.

### Key Figures

This section displays the values for many of the features used, as well as how these values change across different packet loss ratioes and latencies. 

The graphs below show the average packet size sent in bytes in each interaction over different packet loss ratioes and latencies, respectively.

### Future Impact

In terms of future impact, we believe this sort of analysis will be instrumental in the future of the industry. Using models to predict network conditions based on real-world data will have huge positives and the beauty of this process is that as more and more data gets fed into the model, the more accurate it becomes. It is an ever evolving study that will only get better with time and we feel like it can have a huge impact on the satisfaction of customers if coupled with some sort of monitoring API.
