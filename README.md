## Introduction

The premise of this project would be to use the newly designed randomness features of DANE to generate a dataset that is more indicative of real network traffic data. This dataset would then be used to extract features, build models, and ultimately test models for packet loss and latency predictions. We would be using a combination of old features from our older models as well as designing new ones with the observations that we find in the EDA. The new models would also be tested for accuracy and compared with the accuracy of our older models which were trained and tested using the old implementation of DANE. We are hoping that the randomness added to DANE will be more representative of the real world and thus the models will be more translatable to be used in the real world.

### Motivating Problem

The motivating problem is that predicting latency and packet loss can be extremely beneficial from a network providers perspective as they aim to give out the best service possible. This information is vital in the monitoring of network conditions to ensure the quality of the product.
